description: <a href="https://github.com/BeardandFedora/HopStack" target="_blank">HopStack</a> is a beautifully crafted application stack for software teams. It's great for people who already build scalable applications using AngularJS, Bootstrap, Coffeescript, and SASS and is easy enough for anyone who understands HTML5, jQuery, and CSS.
